## Overview

perfct.io is a consent-first meeting sidekick that captures people, faces, names, and "vibes," then surfaces human-sounding prep and in-the-moment prompts across your meetings. Built as a CS1060 Final Project, this prototype addresses the memory challenge college students face when meeting dozens of people every week.
